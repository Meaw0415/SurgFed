**SurgFed** is a multi-task federated learning framework designed for surgical video understanding. It incorporates language-guided semantic priors to collaboratively perform multiple tasks (e.g., surgical scene segmentation and depth estimation) across decentralized clinical datasets while preserving data privacy. SurgFed demonstrates strong generalization and cross-institutional robustness on various real-world surgical video datasets.

## ✅ To-Do List

- [ ] 🗂️ Release all pre-processed surgical datasets (EndoVis2017, EndoVis2018, AutoLaparo, SCARED, StereoMIS, etc.)
- [ ] 🧹 Refactor and clean the codebase for better readability and modularity

More features and documentation will be released soon. Stay tuned!
