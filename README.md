**SurgFed** is a multi-task federated learning framework designed for surgical video understanding. It incorporates language-guided semantic priors to collaboratively perform multiple tasks (e.g., surgical scene segmentation and depth estimation) across decentralized clinical datasets while preserving data privacy. SurgFed demonstrates strong generalization and cross-institutional robustness on various real-world surgical video datasets.
